## Capstone Project

This project involves predictive modeling using regression techniques on a dataset (cscpopendata.csv) with a focus on estimating the ChemicalCount variable. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, feature scaling, and implementation of three regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Visualizations such as histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots were used to understand data distribution, correlation, and outlier presence. Model performance was evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², and MAPE, with the Random Forest Regressor delivering the best results (R² = 0.89). Due to very small actual values in the target variable, MAPE was found to be misleading and excluded from final assessment. The project demonstrates that tree-based models outperform linear approaches for this data due to underlying non-linear patterns.
